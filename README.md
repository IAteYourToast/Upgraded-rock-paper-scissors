# 🎮 Upgraded Rock-Paper-Scissors

I made this game for fun because I was bored of playing classic Rock-Paper-Scissors. This version adds a ton of fun twists, types, and strategy!

## 🕹️ How to Play

- **Play with two hands**  
  Say: `Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!`
  
- **Choose two attacks** (one for each hand)  
  Example: `Rock & Dragon` or `Nuke & Shield`

- **Final match**  
  After revealing both hands, pick **one** of your chosen attacks to actually use.  
  Example: If you chose `Nuke` and `Shield`, you might pick `Nuke` for the final play.

- **Abilities**  
  Each player gets **ONE special ability** for the entire match.

- **Health System**  
  Every player starts with **6 lives**. Losing a round costs lives depending on the move's power.

## 📘 Rules to Remember
